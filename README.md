# TSPGenetic

#### Introduction:

The goal is to use *Genetic Algorithm* to 'solve' The *Traveling Salesman Problem*

#### Overview:

A brief overview of this implementation:

* Java2D and Swing for drawing, controls, general UI.
* A Genetic Algorithm to evolve populations of solutions untill we find a near-optimal solution.
* Three main compoments: A Viewer (draws the graph), Logger (debug info), ControlPanel (Buttons for controlling our simulation)
